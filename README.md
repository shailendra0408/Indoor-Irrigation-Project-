Use case of IOT in Smart gardening. A simple code for Arduino and Android. 

This repo include Andorid App code as well as Ardunio code. Android app and Arduino communicate over 
HC-05 bluetooth module which use simple AT commands. This app is in the very intitial stage of development 
and we had not added any additional features apart from showing readings and turning a motor ON or OFF 
based on the commands received by the app on the arduino side.
